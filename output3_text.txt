Summary
Background Conventional meta-analyses have shown inconsistent results for eﬃ  cacy of second-generation 
antidepressants. We therefore did a multiple-treatments meta-analysis, which accounts for both direct and indirect 
comparisons, to assess the eﬀ ects of 12 new-generation antidepressants on major depression.
Methods We systematically reviewed 117 randomised controlled trials (25 928 participants) from 1991 up to 
Nov 30, 2007, which compared any of the following antidepressants at therapeutic dose range for the acute treatment 
of unipolar major depression in adults: bupropion, citalopram, duloxetine, escitalopram, ﬂ uoxetine, ﬂ uvoxamine, 
milnacipran, mirtazapine, paroxetine, reboxetine, sertraline, and venlafaxine. The main outcomes were the proportion 
of patients who responded to or dropped out of the allocated treatment. Analysis was done on an intention-to-treat 
basis.
Findings Mirtazapine, escitalopram, venlafaxine, and sertraline were signiﬁ cantly more eﬃ  cacious than duloxetine 
(odds ratios [OR] 1·39, 1·33, 1·30 and 1·27, respectively), ﬂ uoxetine (1·37, 1·32, 1·28, and 1·25, respectively), 
ﬂ uvoxamine (1·41, 1·35, 1·30, and 1·27, respectively), paroxetine (1·35, 1·30, 1·27, and 1·22, respectively), and 
reboxetine (2·03, 1·95, 1·89, and 1·85, respectively). Reboxetine was signiﬁ cantly less eﬃ  cacious than all the other 
antidepressants tested. Escitalopram and sertraline showed the best proﬁ le of acceptability, leading to signiﬁ cantly 
fewer discontinuations than did duloxetine, ﬂ uvoxamine, paroxetine, reboxetine, and venlafaxine.
Interpretation Clinically important diﬀ erences exist between commonly prescribed antidepressants for both eﬃ  cacy 
and acceptability in favour of escitalopram and sertraline. Sertraline might be the best choice when starting treatment 
for moderate to severe major depression in adults because it has the most favourable balance between beneﬁ ts, 
acceptability, and acquisition cost.
Funding None.
Introduction
In the past 20 years, several new drugs have been 
introduced for the treatment of depression, many of 
which are structurally related and share similar putative 
mechanisms of action. As with statins for the prevention 
of coronary events,1 the extent to which these agents vary 
in terms of eﬃ  cacy and acceptability is unclear. Moreover, 
some of the new drugs are so-called me-too drugs2—ie, 
chemically similar to existing drugs with expiring patents 
rather than genuine advances in treatment. Systematic 
reviews have already highlighted some diﬀ erences in 
eﬃ  cacy between second-generation antidepressants.3–9
We report an overview of all randomised controlled 
trials that compared 12 new-generation antidepressants 
in terms of eﬃ  cacy and acceptability in the acute-phase 
treatment of major depression. We used multiple-treat-
ments meta-analysis,10 also known as mixed-treatment 
comparisons meta-analysis or network meta-analysis, 
which allows the integration of data from direct (when 
treatments are compared within a randomised trial) and 
indirect comparisons (when treatments are compared 
between trials by combining results on how eﬀ ective they 
are compared with a common comparator treatment).11 
We aimed to provide a clinically useful summary of the 
results of the multiple-treatments meta-analysis that can 
be used to guide treatment decisions.
Methods
Study selection and data collection
At the beginning of this project, we drafted a study 
protocol and subsequently made it freely available to the 
public on our institutional website before carrying out 
the ﬁ nal analyses. Furthermore, with the publication of 
this paper the overall data set will be in the public 
domain.
For our analysis, we included only randomised controlled 
trials that compared any of the following 12 new-generation 
antidepressants 
(bupropion, 
citalo pram, 
duloxetine, 
escitalopram, ﬂ uoxetine, ﬂ uvoxamine, milnacipran, mirta-
zapine, paroxetine, reboxetine, sertra line, and venlafaxine) 
as monotherapy in the acute-phase treatment of adults 
with unipolar major depression. We excluded placebo 
groups where present and randomised controlled trials of 
women with post-partum depres sion.12
To identify the relevant studies, we reviewed the 
Cochrane collaboration depression, anxiety, and neurosis 
review group controlled trials registers (CCDANDTR-
studies and CCDANCTR-references) up to Nov 30, 2007.

We 
asked 
pharmaceutical 
companies, 
regulatory 
agencies, and study investigators to supply all available 
information.
Two persons within the reviewing team independently 
reviewed references and abstracts retrieved by the search, 
assessed the completeness of data abstraction, and 
conﬁ rmed quality rating. We used a structured data-
abstraction form to ensure consistency of appraisal for 
each study. Investigators were contacted and asked to 
provide data to supplement the incomplete reporting of 
the original articles.
We gave studies a quality rating of adequate, unclear, or 
inadequate, according to the adequacy of the random 
allocation concealment and blinding.13 Studies that scored 
adequate or unclear on these criteria were included in 
the ﬁ nal list.
Outcome measures
We deﬁ ned acute treatment as 8-week treatment for 
both eﬃ  cacy and acceptability analyses.14 If 8-week data 
were not available, we used data ranging between 6 and 
12 weeks (we gave preference to the timepoint given in 
the original study as the study endpoint). Response and 
dropout rates were chosen as primary outcomes, being 
the 
most 
consistently 
reported 
estimates 
of 
acute-treatment eﬃ  cacy and acceptability. We deﬁ ned 
response as the proportion of patients who had a 
reduction of at least 50% from the baseline score on the 
Hamilton 
depression 
rating 
scale 
(HDRS) 
or 
Montgomery–Åsberg depression rating scale (MADRS), 
or who scored much improved or very much improved 
on the clinical global impression (CGI) at 8 weeks. 
When trials reported results from all three rating scales, 
we used the HDRS results. Finally, we deﬁ ned treatment 
discontinuation (acceptability) as the number of patients 
who terminated the study early for any reason during 
the ﬁ rst 8 weeks of treatment (dropouts).
Comparability of dosages
In addition to internal and external validity, we assessed 
the comparability of dosages. Because we could not ﬁ nd 
any clear deﬁ nitions about equivalence of dosages 
among new-generation antidepressants in the published 
literature, we used a modiﬁ ed version of a previously 
published classiﬁ cation described by Gartlehner and 
colleagues8 (table 1). We employed this information to 
detect inequalities in dosing that could aﬀ ect comparative 
eﬃ  cacy, and used it in a sensitivity analysis by deﬁ ning 
within the therapeutic dose only those studies that used 
comparable dosages within the predeﬁ ned range.
Statistical analysis
We chose a dichotomous primary outcome mainly for 
clinical reasons. We used both the number of patients 
who responded and the number of patients who 
dropped out to have hard outcome measures of both 
treatment eﬃ  cacy and acceptability. We used response 
rate instead of a continuous symptom score for eﬃ  cacy 
analysis to make the interpretation of results easier for 
clinicians.15 When dichotomous eﬃ  cacy outcomes 
were not reported, but baseline scores, endpoint 
means, and standard deviations (SD) of the depression 
rating scales (such as HDRS or MADRS) were 
provided, we estimated the number of patients 
responding to treatment at 8 weeks (range 6–12 weeks)

with a validated imputation method.16 Responders to 
treatment were calculated on an intention-to-treat 
basis: the analysis was based on the total number of 
randomly assigned participants, irrespective of how 
the original study investigators analysed the data. To 
carry out a clinically sound analysis, we used a 
conservative approach and imputed outcomes for the 
missing participants assuming that they did not 
respond to treatment.
First, we did pair-wise meta-analyses by synthesising17 
studies that compared the same interventions with a 
random-eﬀ ects model18 to incorporate the assumption 
that diﬀ erent studies assessed diﬀ erent, yet related, 
treatment eﬀ ects.17 We used visual inspection of the 
forest plots to investigate the possibility of statistical 
heterogeneity, and the I2 statistic.19 We did the analyses 
using Stata version 9.
Second, we did a random-eﬀ ects model within a 
Bayesian framework using Markov chain Monte Carlo 
methods in WinBUGS (MRC Biostatistics Unit, 
Cambridge, UK).11 We modelled the binary outcomes in 
every treatment group of every study, and speciﬁ ed the 
relations among the odds ratios (ORs) across studies 
making diﬀ erent comparisons.10 This method combines 
direct and indirect evidence for any given pair of 
treatments. We used p values less than 0·05 and 
95% CIs (according to whether the CI included the null 
value) to assess signiﬁ cance, and looked at a plausible 
range for the magnitude of the population diﬀ erence.20 
We also assessed the probability that each antidepressant 
drug was the most eﬃ  cacious regimen, the second best, 
the third best, and so on, by calculating the OR for each 
drug compared with an arbitrary common control 
group, and counting the proportion of iterations of the 
Markov chain in which each drug had the highest OR, 
the second highest, and so on. We ranked treatments in 
terms of acceptability with the same methods.
A key assumption behind multiple-treatments meta-
analysis is that the analysed network is coherent—ie, 
that direct and indirect evidence on the same 
comparisons do not disagree beyond chance. To 
estimate incoherence, we calculated the ratio of odds 
ratios for indirect versus direct evidence whenever 
indirect estimates could be constructed with a single 
common comparator. We deﬁ ned incoherence as the 
disagreement between direct and indirect evidence with 
a 95% CI excluding 1. 
Finally, we looked at comparative eﬃ  cacy among the 
12 antidepressant drugs. We expressed these using 
ﬂ uoxetine as reference drug, because it was the ﬁ rst 
among these 12 antidepressants to be marketed in 
Europe and the USA, and it has been consistently used 
as reference drug among the diﬀ erent pair-wise 
comparisons. 
We did sensitivity analyses according to the following 
variables: dose (including only studies within the 
therapeutic range) and imputation (including only 
studies without imputation). To investigate the eﬀ ect of 
sponsorship on outcome estimate, we carried out a 
meta-regression analysis.

participants (64%) were women. 24 595 were included in 
the eﬃ  cacy analysis (111 studies) and 24 693 in the 
acceptability analysis (112 studies). The mean duration of 
the studies was 8·1 weeks and the mean sample size was 
109·8 participants per group (range 9–357), 62 trials 
having at least 100 participants per group. 85 studies 
were two-arm trials; 23 were three-arm trials involving 
two diﬀ erent active comparisons and placebo; seven were 
multi-arm trials involving two active compounds at 
various ﬁ xed dosages and placebo; and two were 
three-arm trials with three diﬀ erent active comparisons.61,62 
Only 14 studies (comparing all included antidepressants 
except ﬂ uvoxamine and milnacipran) had a follow-up 
longer than 12 weeks. We obtained supplementary 
information about outcome data from the investigators 
for 42 of the included studies. In terms of clinical 
characteristics, 53 studies (9321 participants) included 
individuals aged 65 years or younger (eight recruited only 
individuals older than 65, n=1583), and 87 were carried 
out in outpatient clinics (seven in primary care). The 
overall mean baseline score at study entry was 
23·47 (SD 4·27) for HDRS-17, 25·72 (4·62) for HDRS-21,

and 30·09 (4·64) for MADRS. Most trials were rated as 
unclear according to our quality assessment and only 
12 were rated as adequate. Figure 2 shows the network of 
eligible 
comparisons 
for 
the 
multiple-treatments 
meta-analysis. Of the 66 possible pair-wise comparisons 
between the 12 treatments, 42 have been studied directly 
in one or more trials for eﬃ  cacy and 41 for acceptability. 
We did direct comparisons (table 3), showing that eﬃ  cacy 
favours escitalopram over citalopram; citalopram over 
reboxetine and paroxetine; mirtazapine over ﬂ uoxetine 
and venlafaxine; sertraline over ﬂ uoxetine; and venlafaxine 
over ﬂ uoxetine and ﬂ uvoxamine. These results arise from 
42 independent analyses without adjustment for multiple 
testing (ie, about two CIs would be expected to exclude 1 by 
chance alone). For dropouts, ﬂ uoxetine was better tolerated 
than reboxetine, and citalopram than sertraline.
Overall, heterogeneity was moderate, although for most 
comparisons the 95% CI included values that showed 
very high or no heterogeneity, reﬂ ecting the small 
number of included studies for each pair-wise 
comparison. In the meta-analyses of direct comparisons, 
we found I2 values higher than 75% for the comparisons 
citalopram and reboxetine (I2=85·0%), and escitalopram 
and ﬂ uoxetine (I2=82·7%). In both cases, only two studies 
were included in the meta-analysis.
Figure 3 summarises the results of the multiple-
treatments meta-analysis. Escitalopram, mirtazapine, 
sertraline, and venlafaxine were signiﬁ cantly more 
eﬃ  cacious than duloxetine, ﬂ uoxetine, ﬂ uvoxamine, 
paroxetine, and reboxetine (even though less clear 
beneﬁ ts were noted with sertraline than with 
escitalopram, venlafaxine, and mirtazapine when 
comparing with duloxetine and ﬂ uvoxamine, with the 
credibility interval for OR slightly more than 1). 
Reboxetine was signiﬁ cantly less eﬃ  cacious than all the 
other 11 antidepressants. These ﬁ ndings arise from 
66 
simultaneous 
comparisons 
and 
about 
three 
statistically signiﬁ cant ﬁ ndings might be expected by 
chance alone. In terms of acceptability, duloxetine and 
paroxetine were less well tolerated than escitalopram 
and sertraline; ﬂ uvoxamine less well tolerated than 
citalopram, escitalopram, and sertraline; venlafaxine 
less well tolerated than escitalopram; reboxetine less 
well tolerated than many other antidepressants, such as 
bupropion, citalopram, escitalopram, ﬂ uoxetine, and 
sertraline; and escitalopram and sertraline were better 
tolerated than duloxetine, ﬂ uvoxamine, paroxetine, and 
reboxetine (ﬁ gure 3).
Mirtazapine, escitalopram, venlafaxine, and sertraline 
were more eﬃ  cacious than ﬂ uoxetine, and ﬂ uoxetine was

more eﬃ  cacious than reboxetine (table 4). In terms of 
acceptability, ﬂ uoxetine was better than reboxetine 
(table 4).
Analysis indicated statistical incoherence in three out 
of 70 comparisons of direct with indirect evidence for 
response 
rate 
(paroxetine–citalopram–escitalopram; 
ﬂ uvoxamine–venlafaxine–mirtazapine; and sertraline–
ﬂ uoxetine–bupropion) and three out of 63 comparisons 
for dropout rate (sertraline–citalopram–escitalopram; 
ﬂ uvoxamine–venlafaxine–mirtazapine; and sertraline–
citalopram–ﬂ uoxetine). These numbers are compatible 
with chance because about six signiﬁ cant ﬁ ndings would 
be expected out of 133 statistical tests. Data extraction 
and data entering were correct, and we could not identify 
any important variable that diﬀ ered across comparisons 
in those loops; however, the number of included studies 
was small.
Exclusion of studies with any treatment dosage outside 
the deﬁ ned therapeutic range and without imputed data 
resulted in 109 and 90 trials, respectively. The 
multiple-treatments meta-analysis model was reﬁ tted 
accordingly and no diﬀ erences in conclusions were 
observed in either set of ORs.
Figure 4 shows the distribution of probabilities of each 
treatment being ranked at each of the possible 12 positions. 
Mirtazapine, escitalopram, venlafaxine, and sertraline 
were among the most eﬃ  cacious treatments, and 
escitalopram, sertraline, bupropion, and citalopram were 
better tolerated than the other remaining antidepressants 
(ﬁ gure 4). The cumulative probabilities of being among 
the four most eﬃ  cacious treatments were: mirtazapine 
(24·4%), escitalopram (23·7%), venlafaxine (22·3%), 
sertraline (20·3%), citalopram (3·4%), milnacipran 
(2·7%), bupropion (2·0%), duloxetine (0·9%), ﬂ uvoxamine 
(0·7%), paroxetine (0·1%), ﬂ uoxetine (0·0%), and 
reboxetine (0·0%). The cumulative probabilities of being 
among the four best treatments in terms of acceptability 
were: escitalopram (27·6%), sertraline (21·3%), bupropion 
(19·3%), 
citalopram 
(18·7%), 
milnacipran 
(7·1%), 
mirtazapine (4·4%), ﬂ uoxetine (3·4%), venlafaxine 
(0·9%), duloxetine (0·7%), ﬂ uvoxamine (0·4%), paroxetine 
(0·2%), and reboxetine (0·1%).

In a meta-regression analysis to assess potential 
sponsorship bias, ORs and ﬁ nal rankings did not 
substantially change. The cumulative probability of 
being among the four best treatments became slightly 
smaller for those drugs in trials which were sponsored 
by the marketing company, with the comparators 
moving up the ranking slightly.
Discussion
Our analysis was based on 117 studies including 
25 928 individuals randomly assigned to 12 diﬀ erent 
new-generation antidepressants. Our ﬁ ndings might 
help to choose among new-generation antidepressants 
for acute treatment of major depression. Some 
antidepressants diﬀ ered both statistically and clinically. 
In terms of response, mirtazapine, escitalopram, 
venlafaxine, and sertraline were more eﬃ  cacious than 
duloxetine, ﬂ uoxetine, ﬂ uvoxamine, paroxetine, and 
reboxetine. In terms of acceptability, escitalopram, 
sertraline, citalopram, and bupropion were better 
tolerated than other new-generation antidepressants. 
These results indicate that two of the most eﬃ  cacious 
treatments (mirtazapine and venlafaxine) might not be 
the best for overall acceptability.
Here, we did not investigate important outcomes, such 
as side-eﬀ ects, toxic eﬀ ects, discontinuation symptoms, 
and social functioning. However, the most important 
clinical implication of the results is that escitalopram and 
sertr aline might be the best choice when starting a 
treatment for moderate to severe major depression 
because they have the best possible balance between 
eﬃ  cacy and acceptability.
We did not do a formal cost-eﬀ ectiveness analysis; 
however, because some new anti depressants are now oﬀ  
patent and available in generic form, their acquisition 
cost is reduced. Indeed, only two of the 12 antidepressants 
(escitalopram and duloxetine) are still on patent in the 
USA and in Europe. Sertraline seems to be better than 
escitalo pram because of its lower cost in most countries. 
How ever, in the absence of a full economic model, this 
recom mendation cannot be made unequivocally because 
several other costs are associated with the use of 
antidepressants.138
Reboxetine, ﬂ uvoxamine, paroxetine, and duloxetine 
were the least eﬃ  cacious and acceptable drugs, making 
them less favour able options when prescribing an acute 
treat ment for major depression. Furthermore, in terms of 
acceptability, reboxetine was the least tolerated agent 
among the 12 anti depressants and was signiﬁ cantly less 
eﬀ ective than all the other 11 drugs. Therefore, reboxetine 
should not be used as a routine ﬁ rst-line acute treatment 
for major depression.
Findings from this analysis apply only to acute-phase 
treatment (8 weeks) of depression. Clinicians need to

know whether (and to what extent) treatments work 
within a clinically reasonable period. Clinically, the 
assessment of eﬃ  cacy after 6 weeks of treatment or after 
16–24 weeks or more might lead to wide diﬀ erences in 
treatment outcome. In many systematic reviews, the 
ability to provide valid estimates of treatment eﬀ ect is 
limited because trials with diﬀ erent durations of follow-up 
have been combined.139 A systematic review of clinical-trial 
data140 that investigated early response to antidepressants 
employed a common deﬁ nition of early response across 
all included studies. Apart from this study, however, no 
systematic review has investigated the comparative 
eﬃ  cacy of antidepressants in individuals with major 
depression employing a common deﬁ nition of acute 
response that includes a predeﬁ ned follow-up duration.
Most trials included in our analysis did not report 
adequate information about randomisation and allocation 
concealment, and this might undermine the validity of 
overall ﬁ ndings. Nonetheless, all studies on antidepressants 
included in this meta-analysis were very similar in terms 
of design and conduct, and the scant information in terms 
of quality assessment could be more an issue of reporting 
in the text than real defects in study design, as it has been 
commonly found in other systematic reviews.141
Evidence exists of presence of sponsorship bias (ie, the 
bias associated with the commercial interests of 
industrial sponsors) in medicine,142 and there is concern 
about the potential eﬀ ect of ﬁ nancial interests on medical 
publications. Because most studies comparing the 
newest antidepressants (mirtazapine, escitalopram, 
buproprion, and duloxetine) were done by the 
pharmaceutical companies marketing these compounds, 
this might be a source of bias.143 Some discrepancies 
existed 
between 
some 
of 
the 
results 
of 
the 
multiple-treatments meta-analysis and those in the 
direct comparisons (escitalopram vs citalopram and 
mirtazapine vs venlafaxine). These ﬁ ndings emphasise a 
potential advantage of this analysis that incorporates 
indirect and direct comparisons, decreasing the risk for 
possible sponsorship bias. However, limitations of the 
primary trials and potential confounders (such as dose 
issues) can aﬀ ect the validity of the ﬁ ndings. Readers 
cannot fully appreciate the meaning of a study without 
acknowledging the biases in the design and interpretation 
that can arise when a sponsor might beneﬁ t from a study 
publication.144 Such associations should be made clear to 
let anyone judge the relevance of ﬁ ndings.
Placebo-controlled trials are required to adequately 
assess the eﬃ  cacy of novel antidepressant drugs.145 In 
both the USA and Europe, regulatory authorities require 
placebo-controlled studies for marketing authorisation. 
The 
selective 
publication 
of 
placebo-controlled 
antidepressant trials and its eﬀ ect on apparent eﬃ  cacy is 
well recognised146 and there is currently controversy on 
this topic 147 Placebo-controlled trials are mainly designed 
for regulatory approval purposes; to meet both ethical 
and safety requirements, they tend to recruit patients 
with a mild form of disease.148 Although placebo-controlled 
trials can be eﬃ  cient because they need smaller sample 
sizes than non-placebo-controlled trials, diﬃ  culties in 
carrying out these trials when eﬀ ective treatments are 
known to exist can introduce artifacts into clinical 
trials.149
Response to placebo across antidepressant trials has 
been shown to vary and has clearly increased in the past 
two decades, with a similar increase occurring in the 
fraction of patients responding to active medication as 
well.150 The issue of changes in trial outcomes over time is 
still under debate;151 however, the change in placebo 
response does not seem to be directly explained by changes 
in study characteristics.150 Inﬂ ation of baseline severity, for 
example, is likely to be a cause for the temporal rise in 
placebo response rates, which increases the proportion of 
failed trials.150 As placebo-controlled trials of antidepressants 
become increasingly diﬃ  cult to do, it is perhaps time to 
reconsider the standard requirements. Our analysis 
suggests that sertraline is better than other new-generation 
drugs in terms of eﬃ  cacy and acceptability, and could be 
used as a standard comparator in phase III and also in 
pragmatic (or eﬀ ectiveness) trials to increase the real-world 
applicability of the results. Although the sample-size 
requirements might be larger than in the ideal 
placebo-controlled 
trial, 
the 
increased 
real-world 
applicability of the results would, in our opinion, oﬀ set 
this disadvantage. Furthermore, the need of new 
treatments to show either greater eﬃ  cacy or acceptability 
than an existing standard therapy would serve as a 
disincentive to the development of me-too agents that 
oﬀ er little to patients other than increased costs.
