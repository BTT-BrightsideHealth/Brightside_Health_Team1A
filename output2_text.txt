Objective: About half of outpatients
with major depressive disorder also have
clinically meaningful levels of anxiety. The
authors conducted a secondary data
analysis to compare antidepressant treat-
ment outcomes for patients with anxious
and nonanxious major depression in Lev-
els 1 and 2 of the STAR*D study.
Method: A total of 2,876 adult outpa-
tients with major depressive disorder, en-
rolled from 18 primary and 23 psychiatric
care sites, received citalopram in Level 1
of STAR*D. In Level 2, a total of 1,292 pa-
tients who did not remit with or tolerate
citalopram were randomly assigned ei-
ther to switch to sustained-release bupro-
pion (N=239), sertraline (N=238), or ex-
tended-release venlafaxine (N=250) or to
continue taking citalopram and receive
augmentation with sustained-release bu-
propion (N=279) or buspirone (N=286).
Treatment could last up to 14 weeks in
each level. Patients were designated as
having anxious depression if their anxi-
ety/somatization factor score from the 17-
item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale
(HAM-D) was 7 or higher at baseline. Rates
of remission and response as well as
times to remission and response were
compared between patients with anxious
depression and those with nonanxious
depression.
Results: In Level 1 of STAR*D, 53.2% of
patients had anxious depression. Remis-
sion was significantly less likely and took
longer to occur in these patients than in
those with nonanxious depression. Rat-
ings of side effect frequency, intensity,
and burden, as well as the number of se-
rious adverse events, were significantly
greater in the anxious depression group.
Similarly, in Level 2, patients with anxious
depression fared significantly worse in
both the switching and augmentation op-
tions.
Conclusions: Anxious depression is asso-
ciated with poorer acute outcomes than
nonanxious depression following antide-
pressant treatment.
(Am J Psychiatry 2008; 165:342–351)
Patients with major depressive disorder often also suf-
fer from anxiety, nervousness, and the somatic correlates
of these states (1). In patients with high levels of anxiety
accompanying major depression, greater severity of de-
pressive illness and functional impairment (2), greater ill-
ness chronicity (3), and an increased risk of suicidality (4)
have been reported.
Although DSM-IV (5) does not recognize anxious de-
pression as a diagnostic subtype, emerging evidence sug-
gests a number of distinguishing features for this potential
subtype (2, 3, 6). In outpatients with major depression,
earlier studies reported lifetime comorbidity rates of 40%–
50% (7, 8) for anxiety disorders. More recently, in two dis-
tinct large subsamples of outpatients with major depres-
sion in the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve
Depression (STAR*D) project (6, 9), the proportion with
anxious depression (those having a baseline 17-item
Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression [HAM-D] anxiety/
somatization factor score ≥7) was in the range of 44%–
46%. In both subsamples, patients with anxious depres-
sion were significantly more likely to be unemployed, to
have less education, to be more severely depressed, to
have more concurrent anxiety disorders, and to report
more melancholic/endogenous features, even after ad-
justment for severity of depression.
Previous research has also shown that individuals expe-
riencing major depressive disorder with high levels of anx-
iety symptoms have a slower response to treatment (10)
and, in some (11–13) but not all (4, 14) short-term studies,
are less likely than those without high levels of anxious
symptoms to respond to antidepressant treatment, re-
gardless of the type of antidepressant used. The associa-
tion between anxious depression and poorer response to
antidepressant treatment may account for the results of a
study showing that the concomitant use of anxiolytics or
sedative/hypnotics was a significant predictor of treat-
ment resistance in older adults with depression (15).
On the basis of the available literature, we hypothesized
that patients with anxious depression would be signifi-
cantly less likely than patients with nonanxious depres-
sion to respond to, or achieve remission with, antidepres-
sant treatment. We tested these hypotheses by examining

treatment outcomes with antidepressant treatment in pa-
tients with anxious versus nonanxious major depression
in Levels 1 and 2 of the STAR*D study.
Method
Study Overview and Organization
The rationale, design, and methods of STAR*D have been de-
tailed elsewhere (16, 17). Briefly, STAR*D aimed to determine pro-
spectively which of several treatments would be most effective for
outpatients with nonpsychotic major depressive disorder who
have an unsatisfactory clinical outcome with an initial treatment
and, if necessary, subsequent treatment(s). Participants were en-
rolled at 18 primary care and 23 specialty care settings across the
United States. Three-quarters of the facilities were privately
owned, and about one-third were hospital based. Clinical re-
search coordinators at each site assisted participants and clini-
cians in protocol implementation and collection of clinical mea-
sures. A central group of research outcome assessors conducted
telephone interviews to obtain primary outcome measure data.
Study Population
Prior to study entry, all risks, benefits, and potential adverse
events associated with participation in the study were explained
to participants, who provided written informed consent in a pro-
tocol approved by institutional review boards.
To enhance the generalizability of findings, study eligibility was
limited to self-declared outpatients (no symptomatic volunteers)
seeking treatment and identified by their clinicians as having ma-
jor depressive disorder requiring treatment. Advertising for
symptomatic volunteers was proscribed. Broadly inclusive selec-
tion criteria were used (16, 17). For eligibility, patients had to be
18–75 years of age, meet DSM-IV criteria for single or recurrent
nonpsychotic major depressive disorder (established by treating
clinicians and confirmed by a DSM-IV checklist), have a score ≥14
(indicating moderate severity) on the 17-item HAM-D (18) as
rated by a clinical research coordinator, and not have been treat-
ment resistant in an adequate trial of an antidepressant during
the current episode. Exclusion criteria have been described else-
where (16, 17).
Definition of Anxious Depression
As in our previous studies (6, 9, 19), anxious depression was de-
fined as major depressive disorder with high levels of anxiety
symptoms, as reflected in a HAM-D anxiety/somatization factor
score ≥7. The anxiety/somatization factor, derived from Cleary
and Guy’s (20) factor analysis of the HAM-D scale, includes six
items from the original 17-item version: the items for psychic
anxiety, somatic anxiety, gastrointestinal somatic symptoms,
general somatic symptoms, hypochondriasis, and insight. We
used the baseline HAM-D score (obtained by research outcome
assessors) to assess for the presence of anxious depression.
Baseline Measures
At baseline, clinical research coordinators collected standard
demographic information, self-reported psychiatric history, and
current general medical conditions as evaluated by the Cumula-
tive Illness Rating Scale (21). They administered the HAM-D and
assessed depressive symptoms using the clinician-rated 16-item
Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS-C); pa-
tients completed the self-report version of the QIDS (QIDS-SR)
(22–25). Patients also completed the Psychiatric Diagnostic
Screening Questionnaire (26, 27), which is used to assess for the
presence of 11 potential concurrent DSM-IV disorders. Based on
prior reports (26), we used thresholds with a 90% specificity in re-
lation to the gold-standard diagnosis rendered by a structured in-
terview to define the presence of concomitant axis I disorders.
Current general medical conditions were assessed by the 14-item
Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (21, 28); for this instrument, a
manual (29) was used to guide scoring.
The research outcome assessors, blind to treatments and work-
ing from locations separate from clinical sites, conducted telephone
interviews to complete the HAM-D and the 30-item clinician-rating
version of the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (23, 30).
Responses to items on these measures were used to estimate the
presence of atypical (31), melancholic (32), and anxious (6) symp-
tom features.
An interactive voice response system (33) was used to collect
data from patients on their health perceptions (with the 12-Item
Short Form Health Survey [34]), quality of life (with the Quality of
Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire [35]), and occupa-
tional and interpersonal adjustment (with the Work and Social
Adjustment Scale [36]).
Course of Treatment Measures
An integral part of our measurement-based care intervention
(37) was the collection, at each visit, of clinically relevant infor-
mation to inform treatment decision making. At each clinic visit,
the QIDS-C and QIDS-SR ratings were obtained, and side effects
were assessed using three 7-point scales to rate their frequency,
intensity, and global burden (17, 38).
Intervention
The aim of citalopram treatment in Level 1 was to achieve
symptom remission, which was defined as QIDS-C score ≤5. The
protocol (17) required a fully adequate dose of citalopram for a
sufficient time to maximize the likelihood of achieving remission,
so those who did not achieve remission were truly resistant to the
medication.
Dose adjustments were guided by recommendations in a
treatment manual (www.star-d.org) that allowed individualized
starting doses and dose adjustments to minimize side effects,
maximize safety, and optimize the chances of therapeutic benefit
for each patient. Citalopram was to begin at 20 mg/day and be
raised to 40 mg/day by weeks 2–4 and to 60 mg/day (final dose)
by weeks 4–6. Dose adjustments were guided by how long a pa-
tient had received a particular dose, symptom changes, and side
effect burden.

ANXIOUS AND NONANXIOUS DEPRESSION IN STAR*D
ajp.psychiatryonline.org
The protocol recommended treatment visits at 0, 2, 4, 6, 9, and
12 weeks, with an optional visit at week 14 if needed. After an op-
timal trial of citalopram (based on dose and duration), patients
whose symptoms responded or remitted could enter the 12-
month naturalistic follow-up phase, but all who did not achieve
remission were encouraged to enter the next randomized trial in
the STAR*D sequence (Level 2). Patients could discontinue citalo-
pram before 12 weeks if intolerable side effects made a medica-
tion change necessary, if an optimal dose increase was not possi-
ble because of side effects or patient choice, or if significant
symptoms (as indicated by a QIDS-C score ≥9) were present after
9 weeks at maximally tolerated doses. Patients could opt to move
to the next treatment level if they had intolerable side effects or if
their QIDS-C score was >5 after a trial of adequate dosage and du-
ration. A treatment manual, initial didactic instruction, ongoing
support and guidance by the clinical research coordinator, the
use of a structured evaluation of depressive symptoms and side
effects at each visit, and a centralized treatment monitoring and
feedback system together represented an intensive effort to pro-
vide consistent, high-quality care (37; see also www.star-d.org).
Safety Assessments
To monitor side effects and serious adverse events, a multi-
tiered approach (39) was used, involving the clinical research co-
ordinators, the study clinicians, the interactive voice response
system, the clinical manager, safety officers, regional center di-
rectors, and the National Institute of Mental Health’s Data Safety
and Monitoring Board.
Concomitant Medications
Concomitant treatments for current general medical condi-
tions, for associated symptoms of depression (e.g., sleep and agi-
tation), and for citalopram’s side effects were permitted, based on
clinical judgment, at study entry or during the treatments.
Main Outcome Measures
The primary outcome measure was the HAM-D score, ob-
tained by research outcome assessors using telephone-based
structured interviews at entry and exit from citalopram treat-
ment. Secondary outcome measures included the QIDS-SR and
the rating scale for frequency, intensity, and burden of side effects
at baseline and at each treatment visit.
Statistical Analysis
Remission was defined as an exit HAM-D score ≤7 or last ob-
served QIDS-SR score ≤5. As defined in the original study pro-
posal, patients for whom the exit HAM-D score was missing were
designated as not achieving remission. Response was defined as
a reduction of ≥50% from baseline in the QIDS-SR score at the
last assessment. Intolerance was defined a priori as either leav-
ing treatment before 4 weeks or leaving at or after 4 weeks with
intolerance as the identified reason. The alpha level in analyses
was set at 0.05 (two-sided). No adjustments were made for multi-
ple comparisons.
Baseline clinical and demographic features, treatment fea-
tures, and rates of side effects and serious adverse events were
compared between patients with anxious and nonanxious de-
pression. Student’s t tests and Mann-Whitney U tests were used
for continuous variables, and chi-square tests were used for dis-
crete variables.
Logistic regression models were used to compare remission
and response rates after adjustment for baseline severity of de-
pression (as measured by the QIDS-SR) and regional center. Bi-
variate logistic regression models were used to examine the asso-
ciation of remission rates (using both the HAM-D and the QIDS-
SR criteria) with several independent variables: presence of anx-
ious depression; total score on the HAM-D anxiety/somatization
factor; total score on the HAM-D psychic and somatic anxiety
items; and presence of any comorbid anxiety disorder.
Cross-tabulations of remission (as measured by either the
HAM-D or the QIDS-SR criteria) with each possible threshold on
the HAM-D anxiety/somatization factor were obtained, and the
sensitivity and specificity at each threshold were calculated and
graphed.
We also plotted the number of anxiety symptoms based on the
HAM-D anxiety/somatization factor versus the percentage of pa-
tients who achieved remission according to either the HAM-D or
the QIDS-SR criteria.
Time to first remission (with remission defined as a QIDS-SR
score ≤5) and time to first response (≥50% reduction from base-
line QIDS-SR score) were defined as the first observed point in
clinic visit data. Log-rank tests were used to compare the cumula-
tive proportions of patients with and without anxious depression
whose symptoms remitted or responded.
We ran logistic regression models with remission (based on the
HAM-D or QIDS-SR cutoffs) in Level 2 as the outcome and with

Results
Sample Description in Level 1
Of the 4,041 eligible participants, 2,876 constituted the
evaluable sample—those who had a HAM-D score ≥14 (as
assessed by research outcome assessors) and who re-
turned for at least one postbaseline visit in Level 1 of
STAR*D (see supplementary Table 1 in the data supple-
ment that accompanies the online version of this article).
Data on this subsample, which showed significant clinical
and sociodemographic differences from those excluded,
have been reported previously (37). Figure 1 summarizes
the distribution of HAM-D anxiety/somatization factor
scores for the analyzable sample.
Sociodemographic and Clinical Features at 
Baseline
As in our two previous studies (6, 9), anxious depression
was significantly more common than nonanxious depres-
sion among African Americans than in other racial/ethnic
groups; among Hispanics than non-Hispanics; among
those seen in primary care settings than those in psychiat-
ric care settings; among those who were unemployed than
those who were employed; among those who were mar-
ried, divorced, or widowed than among those who had
never married; and among those with less education,
those with public insurance, and those with lesser income.
Patients with more severe depression at baseline (as mea-
sured by the QIDS-SR and the clinician-rating version of
the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology), greater
perceived physical impairment (as measured by the Short
Form Health Survey), more diminished quality of life, and
later onset of major depression were also significantly
more likely to have anxious depression. In addition, anx-
ious depression was associated with a greater likelihood of
reporting suicidal ideation on the HAM-D, a personal his-
tory of attempted suicide, and a family history of drug
abuse. Finally, patients with anxious depression were sig-
nificantly more likely than those with nonanxious depres-
sion to report melancholic or atypical symptom features
and to have more medical comorbidity (as measured by
the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale scores). As for concur-
rent psychiatric comorbidity, individuals with anxious
major depressive disorder were more likely to meet Psy-
chiatric Diagnostic Screening Questionnaire criteria for
generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social pho-
bia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress
disorder, agoraphobia, hypochondriasis, and somatoform
disorder and to have a greater overall number of comorbid
axis I conditions.
Treatment Characteristics in Level 1, by Anxious 
Versus Nonanxious Depression
Patients with anxious depression made fewer visits and
spent less time in treatment than those without anxious
depression (Table 1). Moreover, although the average cit-
alopram dosage did not differ, time on the final dosage
was shorter in the anxious than in the nonanxious depres-
sion group.
Outcomes in Level 1, by Anxious Versus 
Nonanxious Depression
As shown in Table 2, remission rates were significantly
lower in patients with anxious depression, according to
both the HAM-D criterion (22.2% versus 33.4%) and the
QIDS-SR criterion (27.5% versus 38.9%). Response rates
were also significantly lower for patients with anxious de-
pression (41.7% versus 52.8%). These differences re-
mained significant even after adjustment for severity of
depression at baseline and for regional center. In addition,
the anxious depression group had significantly higher
mean QIDS-SR scores at exit and significantly lower raw
QIDS-SR change scores and percentage change in QIDS-

SR scores than the nonanxious depression group. These
differences also remained significant after adjustment for
severity of depression at baseline and for regional center.
Table 3 summarizes the results of the logistic regression
models assessing the association between the presence of
anxiety and/or anxious depression and remission. All the
predictors were consistently and significantly related to
remission status at endpoint. For both endpoints—remis-
sion as defined by the HAM-D and by the QIDS-SR—the
total score of the HAM-D anxiety/somatization factor was
the best predictor (average R2=0.020), followed closely by
the total score of the HAM-D psychic and somatic anxiety
items (average R2=0.016), and then by whether anxious
depression was present (average R2=0.015) and whether
any comorbid anxiety disorders were present (average
R2=0.014).
Patients with anxious depression had a greater reduc-
tion in anxiety/somatization scores than those with
nonanxious depression, but they also had greater residual
symptoms of anxiety/somatization at endpoint than those
without anxious depression (see supplementary Table 2 in
the online supplement).
We examined the sensitivity versus specificity obtained
as a result of the cross-tabulations of remission (defined
with either the HAM-D or the QIDS-SR) with each possible
threshold on the HAM-D anxiety/somatization factor (see
supplementary Figures 1 and 2 in the online supplement).
From these analyses, it appears that the specificity drops
off quickly.
We also plotted the number of anxiety symptoms ac-
cording to the HAM-D anxiety/somatization factor versus
the percentage of patients achieving remission as defined
by either the HAM-D or the QIDS-SR criterion (see Figure
2; see also supplementary Figure 3 in the online supple-
ment). In general, one can observe a downward trend,
with the remission rate dropping as the number of anxiety
symptoms increases.
Tolerability and Side Effects in Level 1, by 
Anxious Versus Nonanxious Depression
Despite similar citalopram dosages in the two groups
and the longer treatment exposure in the nonanxious de-
pression group (Table 1), the anxious depression group
had greater a frequency, intensity, and burden of side ef-
fects than the nonanxious depression group, as well as
more serious adverse events (Table 4). Notably, the num-
ber of hospitalizations for general medical conditions was
strikingly different between the two groups: 40 among the
patients with anxious depression compared with 18
among those with nonanxious depression.
Time to Remission or Response in Level 1, by 
Anxious Versus Nonanxious Depression
The time to first remission (Figure 3) and first response
(Figure 4) differed significantly between the anxious and
nonanxious depression groups: those with nonanxious
depression achieved remission and response sooner on
average than those with anxious depression.
Sample Description of Level 2 Study Participants
In Level 2 of STAR*D, 1,292 adult outpatients with major
depressive disorder who had no remission of symptoms in
Level 1 or could not tolerate citalopram (in the case of the
switch option only) were randomly assigned either to
switch (overall N=727) to sustained-release bupropion (at
a maximal daily dose of 400 mg; N=239), sertraline (at a
maximal daily dose of 200 mg; N=238), or extended-re-
lease venlafaxine (at a maximal daily dose of 375 mg; N=
250) or to continue taking citalopram and receive aug-
mentation (overall N=565) with sustained-release bupro-
pion (at a dose of up to 400 mg per day; N=279) or bus-
pirone (at a dose of up to 60 mg per day; N=286). The
clinical and sociodemographic characteristics of this Level
2 sample have been previously reported (40, 41).

Outcomes in Level 2, by Anxious Versus 
Nonanxious Depression
Table 5 summarizes the remission rates (based on the
HAM-D or the QIDS-SR criteria) by Level 2 treatment and
by whether anxious depression was present at entry into
Level 2. Those with anxious depression fared significantly
worse in both the switching and augmentation options.
The logistic regression analyses did not indicate a moder-
ating effect of anxiety (anxiety and treatment interaction
indicating that a certain treatment works better or worse
in those with anxious depression).
Discussion
This is the largest sample used thus far to examine
whether major depression with anxious features is associ-
ated with a different treatment outcome than nonanxious
major depression. Consistent with much of the literature
(10–13), we found in Level 1 of STAR*D that patients with
anxious depression were less likely to respond or to remit
with citalopram treatment than those with nonanxious
depression. Overall, they also took longer to remit. This as-
sociation between anxious depression and poorer treat-
ment outcomes with citalopram held true regardless of
how we defined anxious depression. Results of all the lo-
gistic regression models we used to assess this association
showed that the average R2 values ranged from 0.014 to
0.020, with the total score of the HAM-D anxiety/somati-
zation factor being the best predictor, followed closely by
the total score of the HAM-D psychic and somatic anxiety
items, and then by whether anxious depression was
present (as defined by a HAM-D anxiety/somatization fac-
tor score ≥7); the worst predictor was whether any concur-
rent anxiety disorders were present. Although these data
and the relatively linear decline in remission rates with in-
creasing anxiety factor scores (Figure 2) may seem to sug-
gest that the anxious/somatic factor should be viewed
more as a continuous dimension than a dichotomous sub-
type, one might argue that there is a certain clinical utility
in the use of a threshold value and that the dichotomy per-
formed well enough in our regression analyses.
In Level 2 of STAR*D, patients with anxious depression
were also less likely than those with nonanxious depres-
sion to achieve remission, regardless of whether their
Level 2 treatment was a switch option or an augmentation
option. This is the first time that a predictor of poorer out-
come with antidepressant treatment in a population with-
out any prior history of treatment resistance has been
confirmed in a population with prospectively defined re-
sistance or intolerance to antidepressant treatment.
The lower HAM-D remission rates observed in the anx-
ious depression group could be due in part to residual
symptoms of anxiety, which may have increased the HAM-
D score, since this scale comprises several anxiety symp-
tom items. On the other hand, lower remission rates for
anxious depression in both Levels 1 and 2 of STAR*D were
also observed with the QIDS-SR, which measures only
core symptoms of major depression and does not include
any items measuring anxiety symptoms.

ANXIOUS AND NONANXIOUS DEPRESSION IN STAR*D
ajp.psychiatryonline.org
Side effect frequency, intensity, and burden in Level 1
were greater among patients with anxious depression than
among those with nonanxious depression, as were serious
adverse events, including those of a psychiatric nature. In
addition, both time in treatment and time on the final cit-
alopram dosage were significantly lower in the anxious
than in the nonanxious depression group, although these
differences were small. Perhaps patients whose illness in-
cluded anxious features were more sensitive to somatic
changes occurring during antidepressant treatment, and
they may have been more likely to drop out on encounter-
ing side effects. These adverse event findings are interest-
ing, as they suggest that this difference may reflect physical
vulnerability rather than a difference in the interpretation
of discomfort.
These findings, taken together with our two previous
STAR*D reports on anxious depression (6, 9), have several
practical implications for the recognition and diagnosis of
anxious depression. The presence of certain clinical and
sociodemographic characteristics should alert us to the
possibility that anxiety may be a prominent feature of a
patient’s major depressive disorder. As recommended by
Robins and Guze (42) and later expanded on by Kendler
(43), a distinct psychiatric diagnostic entity may be con-
sidered valid if it can be shown to have differentiating fea-
tures, evidence of familiality, specific treatment responsiv-
ity, and a unique course. In this and our two previous
studies (6, 9), anxious depression appeared to be associ-
ated with a characteristic clinical profile, independent of
severity of depression. As for familiality, we did not obtain
any family history of anxious depression, so we could not
assess whether this subtype of depression runs in families.
Our results are consistent with the view that anxious de-
pression is associated with specific treatment responsivity,
in that patients with this subtype were less likely to
achieve remission than those with nonanxious depression
after antidepressant treatment, in both Levels 1 and 2 of
STAR*D, regardless of treatment assignment in Level 2. Al-
though more data are needed to provide information on
the specific treatment responsivity and on the familiality
of this condition, the findings of this study, combined with
those of our previous studies, are supportive of the view
that anxious depression might be a valid diagnostic sub-
type of major depressive disorder. Our results also suggest
the need for additional emphasis on the measurement of
symptoms of anxiety during the acute management of
patients with major depression, particularly those whose
symptoms are resolving only slowly and those who con-
tinue to exhibit residual symptoms after an adequate anti-
depressant trial (44).
This study had several limitations that should be taken
into account in interpreting the results and recommenda-
tions. Our definition of anxious depression was based on
the severity of anxiety symptoms as measured by the HAM-
D anxiety/somatization factor. Although the HAM-D does
include anxiety items and its anxiety/somatization factor
has been used in a number of previous studies, it captures
only a limited number of anxiety symptoms. Therefore, the
possibility of a significant risk of misclassification cannot

be ruled out. On the other hand, the association between
anxious depression and poorer treatment outcome with
antidepressant monotherapy in Level 1 of STAR*D held true
regardless of how we defined anxious depression. Another
limitation is that we did not use a clinician-administered
structured diagnostic interview, which might have provided
a more accurate diagnostic picture. Also, since only outpa-
tients with major depression were enrolled in the study, the
clinical correlates and symptom patterns we found to be as-
sociated with anxious depression may be different in inpa-
tients treated for depression. Furthermore, in the absence
of a placebo control, we cannot determine whether these
patients are specifically less responsive to true drug effects
or less responsive to the nonspecific aspects of treatment.
In addition, participants were enrolled from a number of
sites in a nonrandom manner. Finally, patients with anxious
depression had a higher physical illness burden, lower so-
cioeconomic status, greater severity of depression, and
later onset of depression, all of which could themselves be
associated with poorer treatment outcome. It is possible
that more severe or more difficult-to-treat forms of depres-
sion are accompanied by high levels of anxiety and there-
fore that high levels of anxiety in depression are simply an
epiphenomenon of these other forms of depression and do
not represent a different subtype. Similarly, it is possible
that the greater side effect burden in the group with high
levels of anxiety could be explained by the greater number
of general medical conditions in this group.

Patient Perspective
Ms. D, a 45-year-old married woman, presented to our 
clinic with the following chief complaint: “I am very 
nervous, stressed out, and I cry a lot.” She also reported 
poor sleep, frequent awakenings, diminished appetite, 
excessive worrying, headaches and muscle aches, feelings 
of worthlessness and pessimism, inability to enjoy things, 
psychomotor agitation, and restlessness. She endorsed 
some feelings of hopelessness but denied having 
thoughts of death or suicide. Ms. D had a history of 
generalized anxiety since childhood, but this was appar-
ently her ﬁrst episode of major depression. She denied 
any history of alcohol or drug abuse and said that 
occasional use of nicotine made her “more nervous.”
Ms. D was started on a course of antidepressant 
therapy with citalopram. Within a few days of starting the 
medication, she called us expressing her concerns about 
the side effects that she was experiencing; in particular, 
she was worried about the worsening of her insomnia 
and her nervousness. She also reported a number of 
physical symptoms, including dryness of mouth and 
constipation. Ms. D’s anxiety escalated over the next few 
days, and a benzodiazepine was prescribed, which 
brought about a signiﬁcant improvement in her insomnia 
and agitation. Ms. D continued to report a number of 
physical symptoms throughout the ﬁrst 4 weeks of 
treatment, but she was able to remain on citalopram. 
After 6 weeks of combined treatment with citalopram 
and a benzodiazepine, Ms. D reported a signiﬁcant 
improvement in all her symptoms, and remission was 
achieved at the end of the 10th week of treatment.
When the benzodiazepine dosage was decreased soon 
after remission had been achieved, Ms. D reported a 
reemergence of her insomnia and agitation. She and her 
physician agreed that she would maintain the treatment 
combination for at least 6 months. Ms. D did so and 
maintained her remission throughout the continuation 
phase of treatment.
